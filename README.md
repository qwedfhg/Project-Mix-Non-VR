# Project-Mix-Non-VR
This is a mod for the game Project Mix, which allows you to play it from start to finish without a VR headset.

# How to install? 
Download and drop two files into SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Project Mix Demo\PROJECT MIX_Data\Managed

# Why such controls?
The game is very interactive and in order to make a full-fledged good and convenient control for computers, a comprehensive rework of the controls and interactivity is needed, naturally, this will take much more time than a couple of free evenings that i found in this busy month.
I tried to make this VR adaptation for keyboard and mouse as pleasant and convenient to control as possible, hope you'll enjoy it.

# Does the mod change any aspects of the game?
No, the game works exactly the same as if you were playing in a VR headset, although it will be difficult having the same amount of fun due to the reduced dynamism of the game.

# Controls
All the buttons associated with managing dialogues / secret functions remained the same.
(press B to open pause menu)

Controls for the mod itself:

Hold down the *Q* or *E* keys to start controlling the left or right hand, respectively.
When the hand is controlled, you can move it with the mouse, the camera does not move.
To turn the hand, switch it to rotation mode with the *Alt* key and move the mouse. The control changes for both hands at once until you press it again.
To move your hand back and forth, press the side mouse buttons. Most now have them, i hope yours does too.

To pick up an object or grab onto an interactive object, put your hand there and press the left mouse button. If this item has an interactive action on the button (for example, a burner), then press the right mouse button to activate it.
If you want to throw an item far away, then while you control the hand with the item, rotate the mouse wheel forward to throw harder and back if you decide to reduce the force, then simply release the item.

Walking control in free zones is standard WASD, you can speed up a little with *Shift*.
You can sit down with *Tab* in any unclear situation, even in areas where you can't walk.

If you find it difficult to navigate what your throwing force is or in hand rotation mode, you can press *Insert* to enable partial debugging in the upper right corner, it will say whether hand rotation is enabled and what your throwing force is.
The bed trigger has been reassigned to the *F* key.
